Tasks:
 1. Healthbar - Like in the picture with 3-4 hearts.
 2. UI for Pickups - When you pickup a key, to register it with the UI.
 3. Main Menu - Play, Exit, Options (doesn't need to have option button functionality).
 4. Shader - When you are on low health (1 heart) to set a red vignete shader or Screen shake with shader, ***NOT BY MANIPULATING THE CAMERA POSITION*** / Blur when you are hit or whatever you like.
 5. Animate Player States - Walk animation, Jump animation, Hurt animation and if you want some other animation.
 6. Simple AI for Enemy as seen in the first screenshot - Make the AI aggressive when the player is near.
